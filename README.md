Education refers to not learning but discovery, self-discovery. To not only know, but to understand. That's what it means to be truly educated.

This is my pursue of a CS Engineering course despite having a valid CS degree for various reasons, some of which are:

1. Refresher of all the things learnt in college
2. Spend time to fill in the gaps in knowledge on topics I skipped out on
3. Spend time to delve deeper into topics of interest
4. Be more knowledgeable in CS than I currently am
5. Cultivate learning as a skill and a way of life

## Topics

### 1. Introduction to Programming

This is one area which I am confident in, and am therefore skipping. Too easy and boring to start with.
